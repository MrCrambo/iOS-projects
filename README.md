 Applications for iOS devices using Machine Learning and Augmented Reality

### 1. Online Image Recognition

Online image recognition with ResNet50 pretrained model using device camera. Could be used other models from [Apple ML website page](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/). Also you can use your trained model instead of Apple's model, later here will be an example of how to do it.

### 2. Image Recognition on Photo

Image recognition with ResNet50 model on photos chosen using picker(with camera and photo library). Predicted results is better than in first app. Also used auto layout with constraints for UI.
