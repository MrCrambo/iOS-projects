 Applications for iOS devices using Machine Learning and Augmented Reality

### 1. Online Image Recognition

Online image recognition with ResNet50 pretrained model using device camera. Could be used other models from [Apple ML website page](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/). Also you can use your trained model instead of Apples' model, later here will be an example of how to do it.
